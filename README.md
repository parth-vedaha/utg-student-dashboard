# UTG-Student Dashboard
`v0.0.1`

### "A flexible and elegant student management system for the University of The Gambia"

_Dashboard is built by the students for the students._

#### ERP System

Dashboard uses the **UTG's ERP System (Portal)** as a center of verification for users.
The Portal is Dashboard's sole source of data. The data collected are used for,
but not limited to, **verification**, **analysis**, and **presentation**.

#### Try Dashboard

Dashboard has a **Try Dashboard** Functionality by the means of which non-UTG students
can get to temporarily use it, exploring the vast features therein.
Maximum functionality is only provided when user is logged in as a **UTG Student**.

#### "A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step"
Dashboard is an ambitious project, and this is only the beginning.
Also, we wish to integrate the following features in a future release:

- Course Registration
- Student Forum
- Student Voting System


#### License
