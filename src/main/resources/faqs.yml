- question: How do I get to discover my Student Mail address?
  answer: Every student is assigned a unique email address known as the student mail.
    It is a mean by which UTG reaches out to the students, and updates them with the latest campus news.
    Unfortunately, most students will only know about this overdue.
    So, your email is a combination of the first letter of your First Name and Last Name, respectively,
    plus your matriculation number. Discard all the initials (if there's any), and lowercase the letters.
    The password is, by default, your Matriculation Number.

- question: Do I really need to change my Portal Email and Password?
  answer: Just as it is widely know to almost everyone, by default, everyone's email is their
    Mat. Number followed by @utg.edu.gm, whilst the password is simply the Mat. Number.
    This is quite predictable and vulnerable, so it is strongly recommended that you change it.
    Visit the faulty of your department for this changes.
