    that must be done prior to deployment.


- Create SNAPSHOT Tag.
- Cross-check for TODOs.
- Be sure to have dealt with all test-cases, as in the test file.
- Make sure the documentations are in full-sync.
    Documentation in source files := static files := README, logic, etc.
- Make sure Versions are in order.

- Make sure Dashboard.VERSION := Bundle-Version in MANIFEST.MF := <version> in pom.xml
- Test extensively on the three (3) major platforms.
- Replace Dashboard with .dashboard as ROOT_DIR.
    This probably is the latest commit of every release.
- Create a RELEASE Tag. Deploy!
