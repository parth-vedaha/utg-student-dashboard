Dashboard, to a certain extent, relies on the content of the portal.
Any API modification may result to a reading problem, unless otherwise resolved immediately.

# The Navigation tabs at the contents page are indexed as follows
{
0="", 1="", 2="RUNNING COURSES", 3="ALL REGISTERED COURSES", 4="PROGRAM COURSES"
    5="GRADES", 6="TRANSCRIPT", 7="PAYMENTS", 8="REFUNDS"
}
- This, as of 2021-03-22 12:46 AM UTC.
- The indexing is dynamic.
- It's recommended therefore to use the text-content of such elements.
- For this, use `Portal.getTabElement(textOfTab, tabs)`


# Course Codes on the Portal have whitespace between the Program Code and the Number
- E.g. MTH101 => 'MTH 101'
